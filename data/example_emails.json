Educamos no refeitório, no recreio e, claro, também na praia.\n\n                Cada vivência é uma oportunidade: para aprender a respeitar o outro, para valorizar as regras comuns, para descobrir o lado bom das coisas simples. E para cultivar o respeito e a gratidão pela natureza – essa professora silenciosa que tanto nos dá.\n\n                Em anexo, enviaremos a organização prática, com os horários e o que cada criança deverá trazer.\n\n                Até já!\n\n                Margarida del Barco"
